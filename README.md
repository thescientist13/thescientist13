### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I find myself most passionate about helping people learn about technology and how it can help improve their process and workflows. I like to do so through software projects that are well designed, tested, performant, and maintained in a way that advocates for great experiences for all involved.  I like to [write and speak](https://www.thegreenhouse.io/about/#speaking) on a variety of topics, but also love talking about, and getting lost in some code, just as easily.

These days I'm happily mixing it up and focusing on open source and the web. Would love to hear what you're up to, too!
